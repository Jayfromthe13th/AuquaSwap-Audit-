### Critical Findings

### VUL-001: Improper Owner Access Control

**Severity**: Critical  
**Likelihood**: High  
**Location**: `public fun cancel_order`

**Description**:  
The `cancel_order` function does not make any assertion that the signer is the owner of the order before being able to cancel the order and transfer assets to the caller.

**Correct Implementation**:  
```rust
assert!(order.user_address == address_of(user), ERR_PERMISSION_DENIED);
